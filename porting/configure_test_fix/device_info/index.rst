DeviceInfo
==========

DeviceInfo allows to set device specific configuration, which can be accessed in an uniform way using `libdeviceinfo <https://gitlab.com/ubports/development/core/deviceinfo>`_.

Device specific overrides
-------------------------

Configuration files per device are located at ``/etc/deviceinfo/devices/[device].yaml``.
It will try to autodetect the correct configuration to load based on model of the device,
using android props for halium/android devices and dtb for native linux devices.

.. note::
    This file needs to be all lowercase, as any autodetected device name will be converted to lowercase.

For example, the file for the Nexus 7 tablet (flo) would be located at ``/etc/deviceinfo/devices/flo.yaml`` and needs to start with the device's name::

    $ cat /etc/deviceinfo/devices/flo.yaml
    flo:
      DeviceType: tablet
      GridUnit: 18
      WebkitDpr: 2
      PrimaryOrientation: Landscape
      ...

In case you can not add a new file to the rootfs, you can bind-mount ``/etc/deviceinfo/devices/halium.yaml``.
For a reference, see the `configuration bringup for bonito/sargo <https://github.com/fredldotme/android_device_google_bonito/commit/d0ca48aadcde0b74840c3394ac86042033d7f846>`_.

If no device specific configuration exists or a key is not specified for the device config, DeviceInfo will fallback to ``/etc/deviceinfo/default.yaml``.
Keep your configuration simple and try to not duplicate any entries, which are already defined in ``default.yaml``.

Any key can be added without needing to modify deviceinfo to use it.
This allows for a lot of flexibility, however keys should be properly documented in order to not duplicate keys.
