Sound
=====

Ubuntu Touch uses Pulseaudio as sound server. Documentation can be found at `freedesktop.org <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/>`_ and in the `Ubuntu manpages <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/pulseaudio.1.html>`_

The default configuration file used on Ubuntu Touch is ``touch.pa``. This file is located in the ``/etc/pulse`` directory on your device and it will need adjustment in order for sound to function properly. Extract the file and copy it to the ``ubuntu`` directory you created in your device repo (see :ref:`Overlay`).

Locate the line::

    load-module module-droid-discover voice_virtual_stream=true

and replace it with this::

    load-module module-droid-discover rate=48000 quirks=+unload_call_exit

At the end of the file, append this::

    ### Automatically load the audioflinger glue
    .ifexists module-droid-glue-24.so
    load-module module-droid-glue-24
    .endif

Your modified ``touch.pa`` file now needs to be included in your build. Follow :ref:`the overlay file method <Overlay-steps>` corresponding to your Halium version.
