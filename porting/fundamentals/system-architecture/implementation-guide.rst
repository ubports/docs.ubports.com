From Concepts to Implementation
===============================

This guide bridges the gap between understanding Ubuntu Touch's architecture and implementing a port for your device. It provides a practical roadmap for translating system concepts into working code.

Implementation Overview
-----------------------

The porting process involves several key steps:

1. **Hardware Layer**

   * Device kernel configuration
   * Android HAL integration
   * Binary driver support
   * Hardware feature enablement

2. **System Integration**

   * Container setup
   * Service configuration
   * Boot process management
   * System image creation

3. **User Space**

   * Display server setup
   * Interface configuration
   * Application support
   * System services

Making Implementation Choices
-----------------------------

Your implementation path depends on:

1. **Device Age and Support**

   * Modern devices (Android 9+)
   * Legacy devices (pre-Android 9)
   * Vendor support level
   * Available documentation

2. **Hardware Complexity**

   * SoC features
   * Proprietary components
   * Driver availability
   * Hardware interfaces

3. **Build Requirements**

   * Kernel source availability
   * Vendor blob compatibility
   * Build system needs
   * Testing capabilities

Implementation Methods
----------------------

Available approaches:

1. **Standalone Kernel Method**

   Best for:

   * Modern devices
   * Good vendor support
   * Standard hardware
   * Available documentation

2. **Full System Build**

   Required for:

   * Legacy devices
   * Complex hardware
   * Custom requirements
   * Specific vendor needs

3. **GSI-Based Method**

   Suitable for:

   * Treble-compliant devices
   * Standard implementations
   * Modern hardware
   * Reference designs
