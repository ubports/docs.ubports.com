Ubuntu Touch System Architecture
================================

Understanding the Architecture
------------------------------
Think of Ubuntu Touch's architecture like a modern building. Just as a building has different systems working together (electrical, plumbing, heating), Ubuntu Touch has different layers that work together to create a complete mobile operating system.

Core System Components
----------------------
Let's break down each major component and understand its role:

1. **User Interface Layer**
   
   This is like the rooms and furniture in our building - the parts you actually see and interact with:

   * Lomiri (Unity8) interface - The main "floor plan" of your phone
   * Mir display server - The "lighting system" that makes everything visible
   * Qt/QML applications - The "furniture" - apps you use daily
   * System indicators - Like light switches and thermostats - show battery, WiFi, etc.

   Why it matters: This layer determines how you interact with your device. If it's not working, you won't be able to use your phone, even if everything else works perfectly.

2. **System Services**

   These are like the building's utilities - you don't see them, but they're essential:

   * systemd init system - The "main power switch" that starts everything
   * Network management - Like the building's internet and phone lines
   * Power management - Similar to the electrical system
   * Audio routing - Think of it as the building's intercom system

   Common issues:

   * Services failing to start (like a tripped circuit breaker)
   * Services starting in wrong order (like turning on the AC before power)
   * Resource conflicts (like too many appliances on one circuit)

3. **Core Infrastructure**

   This is the building's foundation and structural supports:

   * Click package system - Like the building's elevator system for delivering apps
   * AppArmor security - The building's security system and access controls
   * Wayland protocols - The communication system between components
   * DBus services - Like the building's internal mail system

   Troubleshooting tips:

   * Always check system logs when something fails
   * Verify permissions when apps can't access features
   * Monitor resource usage when system seems slow

How These Work Together
-----------------------
Just as a building's systems must work together (water heater needs both water and electricity), Ubuntu Touch's components are interconnected:

1. When you tap an app icon:

   * Lomiri receives your touch input
   * Mir creates a window for the app
   * systemd ensures necessary services are running
   * AppArmor checks if the app has required permissions

2. When you take a photo:

   * Camera app requests hardware access
   * HAL translates this request for the camera hardware
   * System services manage memory and storage
   * UI layer shows you the viewfinder and controls

Common Integration Points
-------------------------
These are critical areas where components must work together properly:

Hardware Access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* libhybris bridging
* Android hardware services
* Sensor systems
* Camera interfaces

System Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Boot process
* Service supervision
* Resource control
* Update system

Security Model
--------------
* AppArmor confinement
* Permission system
* Encrypted data
* Secure boot support

Configuration Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Key configuration areas:

* Device settings
* Hardware configs
* System policies
* User preferences
