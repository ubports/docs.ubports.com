Build Systems
=============

Understanding the build system is crucial for creating a successful Ubuntu Touch port. This section explains the available build methods and helps you choose the right approach for your device.

Quick Reference
---------------
Essential concepts:

* Build environment setup
* Device configuration
* System image creation
* Hardware integration
* Testing and verification

Core Components
---------------

The Ubuntu Touch build system integrates several key elements:

1. **Device Configuration**
   
   * Hardware definitions
   * System properties
   * Build parameters
   * Feature flags

2. **Source Management**
   
   * Kernel sources
   * Android components
   * System services
   * Hardware support

3. **Image Creation**
   
   * Boot images
   * System images
   * Recovery support
   * Partition layout

Build Methods
-------------

Available build approaches:

1. **Modern Method**
   
   Best for current devices:

   * Android 9.0 or newer
   * Project Treble support
   * Available kernel source
   * Standard hardware support

   Benefits:
   * Simpler process
   * Better maintainability
   * Faster iteration
   * Standard interfaces

2. **Legacy Method**
   
   Required for older devices:

   * Pre-Android 9.0
   * Custom hardware support
   * Specific vendor needs
   * Legacy compatibility

   Considerations:
   * More complex setup
   * Deeper customization
   * Full system build
   * Vendor-specific code

   * Community support
   * Documentation

Implementation Path
-------------------

Steps for successful builds:

1. **Environment Setup**
   
   * Tool installation
   * Dependency management
   * Source preparation
   * Build configuration

2. **Device Preparation**
   
   * Configuration files
   * Hardware definitions
   * System properties
   * Build parameters

3. **Build Process**
   
   * Image creation
