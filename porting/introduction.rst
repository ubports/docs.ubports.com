Porting information
===================

.. Note::
    If you are looking for information on installing Ubuntu Touch on a supported device, or if you would like to check if your device is supported, please see `this page <https://ubports.com/page/get-ubuntu-touch>`_.

This section will introduce you to some of the specifics of porting Ubuntu Touch to an Android device.

Before you begin, you'll want to head over to `the Halium porting guide <http://docs.halium.org/en/latest/porting/first-steps.html>`_ and get your ``systemimage`` built without errors. Once you're at the point of installing a rootfs, you can come back here.

Start at :doc:`building-ubports-boot` if you'd like to install the UBports Ubuntu Touch 16.04 rootfs.
