Configuring Ubuntu Touch
========================

In the previous section you adjusted a configuration file directly in the UBports rootfs. The rootfs contains a number of other configuration files with some standard settings that do not necessarily conform to your device. These must be modified to fit your device. The rootfs itself is read only and identical for all devices. You cannot modify the rootfs itself. Instead, the correct way to adjust the configuration is with overlay files, as described below.

.. _Overlay-files:

Overlay files
-------------

Note that as a rule of thumb, the method described below applies if the file you need to edit can be found in the /etc directory (or a subdirectory of this) on your device. You should not attempt to overwrite files located elsewhere with overlay files using this method.

In your device directory, create a subdirectory named 'ubuntu'. Collect the files you wish to inject into your build in this directory. 

Relevant files are for example (but this list is incomplete):
    * 70-android.rules (the udev rules for your device, see previous section)
    * android.conf (for display scaling, see below)
    * touch.pa (for pulseaudio sound configuration/initialization, see below)

These files are then injected by adding a code block to the file ``device.mk`` in your device directory. For the three files above add the following code::

    ### Ubuntu Touch ###
    PRODUCT_COPY_FILES += \
        $(LOCAL_PATH)/ubuntu/70-android.rules:system/halium/lib/udev/rules.d/70-android.rules \
        $(LOCAL_PATH)/ubuntu/android.conf:system/halium/etc/ubuntu-touch-session.d/android.conf \
        $(LOCAL_PATH)/ubuntu/touch.pa:system/halium/etc/pulse/touch.pa 
    ### End Ubuntu Touch ###

Explanation:

The string before the colon '$(LOCAL_PATH)/ubuntu/70-android.rules' specifies the path to the source file to be injected. The string after the colon 'system/halium/lib/udev/rules.d/70-android.rules' specifies where you want it placed on the device.

The general steps to follow are thus:
    1. Copy the file you wish to modify to the 'ubuntu' directory you have created in your device source tree.
    2. Edit the file as needed.
    3. Add a line to the PRODUCT_COPY_FILES section of your device.mk file as shown above.
    4. Rebuild your system.img and reflash together with the ubports rootfs.

.. note::

    The target paths for the files mentioned above are *not* randomly chosen. You must use the specified paths. 

.. note::

    When you specify target path 'system/halium/etc/myfilename' your file 'myfilename' will end up in the '/etc' directory of your device (i.e. without the leading 'system/halium')

When you have made the adjustments you need and prepared your source as described above, you have to rebuild your system.img: ``mka systemimage``. When rebuilding the system image after small changes like these, you need not ``mka clean`` first. However, changes to PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES might not get detected by the build system. Go to your output folder, enter the system folder and delete build.prop in order to get it regenerated.

Udev rules
----------

Extract the file 70-android.rules which you created in the previous section using ``adb pull`` or ``scp`` and copy it to the 'ubuntu' directory of your device source tree. Complete steps 3 and 4 above.

.. _Display-scaling:

Display scaling
---------------

There are two variables that set the content scaling for Unity 8 and Ubuntu Touch applications: ``GRID_UNIT_PX`` and ``QTWEBKIT_DPR``.

There are also other options available that may be useful for you depending on your device's form factor. These are mentioned below and all of these settings are explained in depth in the reference section on :ref:`Display-settings`.

All of these settings are guessed by Unity 8 if none are set. There are many cases, however, where the guess is wrong (for example, very high resolution phone displays will be identified as desktop computers). To manually set a value for these variables, simply edit the file at ``etc/ubuntu-touch-session.d/android.conf`` specifying them. For example, this is the file for the Nexus 7 tablet::

    $ cat /etc/ubuntu-touch-session.d/flo.conf
    GRID_UNIT_PX=18
    QTWEBKIT_DPR=2.0
    NATIVE_ORIENTATION=landscape
    FORM_FACTOR=tablet

The :ref:`Display-settings` section details methods for deriving values for these variables.

Once you have adjusted the ``android.conf`` file to the display settings needed for your device, this file should be incorporated into your build.

Create the file android.conf in your 'ubuntu' directory and enter the settings you determined and tested in the previous section. Complete steps 3 and 4 above.

.. _Apply-apparmor-kernel-patches:

Apply apparmor kernel patches
-----------------------------

`What is apparmor? <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor>`_

Start by downloading the backported `apparmor patch <https://github.com/ubports/apparmor-backports-ut>`_ corresponding to your device's kernel version. Your kernel version is specified at the beginning of your kernel defconfig file, i.e. the one you edited in section :ref:`Edit-kernel-config` above.

You now need to delete your entire BUILDDIR/kernel/VENDOR/MODEL/security/apparmor subdirectory and replace it with the one you downloaded. Then rebuild halium-boot. 

If you get errors when building, you will need to resolve them one by one, modifying your source code as needed. Note that you should only modify the code in the apparmor subdirectory if at all possible. Modifying code elsewhere will more than likely just compound your problems.

Seek help as needed from one of the sources mentioned in section :ref:`Getting-community-help`.

Sound configuration
-------------------

The supplied touch.pa file located in the /etc/pulse directory of your device needs adjustment. Extract the file and copy it to your 'ubuntu' directory. 

Locate the line::

    load-module module-droid-discover voice_virtual_stream=true

and replace it with this::

    load-module module-droid-discover rate=48000 quirks=+unload_call_exit

At the end of the file, append this::

    ### Automatically load the audioflinger glue
    .ifexists module-droid-glue-24.so
    load-module module-droid-glue-24
    .endif

Now complete steps 3 and 4.

Further configuration
