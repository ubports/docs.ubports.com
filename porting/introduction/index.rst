Introduction
============

Porting makes Ubuntu Touch run on new hardware, i.e. devices previously unable to run it. 

Crucial parts of most commercially available devices are not libre software.
The proprietary nature of the parts is a secret specific not only to the manufacturer, but usually also the individual model. 

The real work is building Ubuntu Touch so that it integrates with these proprietary device components so it can "talk to" the hardware. 

With a bit of research and a suitable build environment set up, you too can port Ubuntu Touch.
