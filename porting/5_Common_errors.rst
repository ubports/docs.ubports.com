5   Common errors and problems
==============================

The structure of this section should be:

2 main parts, one for Halium 7.1, the other for Halium 9

Each main part should follow the structure of sections 3 and 4 respectively. 

Each subsection starts with a message similar to: "Known problems related to section 3.3 Building halium-boot.img and system.img for UT"

The subsections in sections 3 and 4 should each have direct links to their relevant subsection of section 5.
