Standalone Kernel Method
========================

The standalone kernel method is the primary approach for modern Ubuntu Touch ports. This method focuses on building just the device kernel, while using pre-built system images and rootfs from UBports.

Quick Reference

1. Configure deviceinfo 
2. Build kernel only (-k flag)
3. Full build after kernel success
4. First boot verification
