Devices
==================

Porting and maintaining the Ubuntu Touch operating system to new devices is one of the hardest things to achieve. Despite of this, UBports community have ported and maintaining a fair amount of devices. 
Devices are catagorized and you can see all of the available information about current status of individual devices below.

Core devices
------------
Core Devices are the Devices that will recieve all the new features, critical security-updates and bug-fixes from UBports. These devices will soon be rebased on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Until then, the existing legacy image (based on 15.04) can be installed.

Legacy devices
--------------
Legacy Devices are devices that will only get critical security-updates and bug-fixes. New features might appear from time to time, but the focus is on the core devices listed above. Pull-requests from the community are accepted and will be merged into the images.
