About Ubuntu Touch
==================

Ubuntu Touch is a mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system that was originally developed by Canonical Ltd. and has since been picked up by the UBports community. However, unlike other 'flavors' of Ubuntu such as Mate, Mint and Gnome, it is more accurately an extract of parts of Ubuntu, where the parts are adapted to allow it to run naturally in a mobile environment but also capable to act as a fully functional desktop or laptop while in 'desktop mode'. 

This aforementioned converging of environments from device to device is where the term Convergence originates. In its current state, it is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, however the goal of Convergence is expected to bring Ubuntu Touch to Laptop/Desktops, IOT devices, TVs and smart watches for a completely unified experience. 

When Mark Shuttleworth, on April 5th, 2017, announced that Canonical Ltd. would terminate support for the project due to a "lack of market interest", it was immediately picked up by the UBports community.  The UBports project was seeded by Marius Gripsgard in 2015 and the programming source code for the project was transferred to the UBports Foundation (a process nearing completion) where it now resides. UBports' mission is to support the collaborative development of Ubuntu Touch and to promote the widespread use of Ubuntu Touch.

Innovative
-------------
Ubuntu Touch offers a completely refreshing approach to the mobile experience. Thanks to the intuitive and clean interface, members of the Ubuntu Touch community report a very 'natural' experience. With a gentle swipe from the edge of the screen, you have access to all of the device's apps, tools and settings. There are no accidental button pushes or hard-to-reach dungeons of your mobile device:  Everything is just a swipe away. This classy and unique operating system will help you stand out in a crowd with the latest fashion in mobile technology.
 
Convergence
-------------
Throughout the entire history of the project, one theme has continued as an exciting thread and hope - Convergence. Ubuntu Touch focuses on hardware minimalism and efficiency. The idea of Convergence is being able to pack a mobile device in your pocket and then simply connect to the screen/hardware of your choice and have it seemlessly integrate with the external peripherals - a desktop computer in your pocket. Benefits of Convergence are endless such as, reduced landfill wastage, saved money, potentially higher security and the convenience of truly mobile computing. Imagine linking your mobile device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard and having it instantly transformed into a desktop experience. With Ubuntu Touch you only need one device. 

Privacy Ensured
---------------
Although Big Brother and others in the world may wish to spy on you and steal your personal data - don't worry.  With Ubuntu Touch - the world's safest system that respects your privacy - they will have nothing to see.  Ubuntu Touch keeps you secure because everything unsafe is blocked by default; the only way that the peepers and creepers can get a peek is if you invite them.  We've got your back.
