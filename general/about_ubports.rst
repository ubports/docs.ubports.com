About UBports
=============

UBports is the foundation/legal entity that stands behind projects like Ubuntu Touch. The UBports project was founded by Marius Gripsgard in 2015 and the programming source code for the project was, thanks to the hard work of many volunteers, picked up and moved into the free software community where the project could not only be maintained but also expanded.

The UBports Foundation's mission is to support the collaborative development of Ubuntu Touch and to promote the widespread use of Ubuntu Touch. It will give users a body to trust in the development of Ubuntu Touch. It will also improve our transparency in funding, spending, and decision making.
