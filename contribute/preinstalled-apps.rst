Preinstalled apps
=================

This page will help you get started with developing the apps which are included with Ubuntu Touch.

Core apps
---------

Core apps are applications which are included with UBports distributions of Ubuntu Touch **and** placed in the OpenStore for updates. Core apps are a good "first development" experience within UBports. Many are built with `Clickable`_, an easy to use build and test system for Ubuntu Touch apps. Most core apps can even be built and run without an Ubuntu Touch device!

Which core apps currently exist?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A full list of the Ubuntu Touch core apps follows.

.. Note for markup travelers: These links are in the "bottom of page" style so they take up less space inside the table.
   Please sort the table alphabetically.
   "Application Name" should be the name that displays in the apps list in English (US)

Other preinstalled apps
-----------------------

The following applications are preinstalled in Ubuntu Touch but are not considered core apps. Most of the time these projects must be updated with the system because they use many system services which do not necessarily have a stable API.

These apps may be more difficult to work with, but their repository should contain a document stating how to build and run them on a device.

.. Please sort this list alphabetically by the app display name in English (US)

* Browser (`morph-browser on GitHub`_)
* Contacts (`address-book-app on GitHub`_)
* Camera (`camera-app on GitLab`_)
* External Drives (`ciborium on GitHub`_)
* Media Player (`mediaplayer-app on GitHub`_)
* Messaging (`messaging-app on GitHub`_)
* Phone (`dialer-app on GitHub`_)
* System Settings (`system-settings on GitHub`_)

Instructions for contributing to these applications can be found in their respective repositories.
