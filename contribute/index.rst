Contributing to UBports
=======================

Welcome! You're probably here because you want to contribute to UBports. The pages you'll find below here will help you do this in a way that's helpful to both the project and yourself.

If you're just getting started, we always need help with :doc:`thorough bug reporting <bugreporting>`. If you are multilingual, :doc:`translations <translations>` are also a great place to start.

If those aren't enough for you, see `our contribute page <https://ubports.com/page/vo-get-involved>`_ for an introduction of our focus groups.
