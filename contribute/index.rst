Contributing to UBports
=======================

Documentation
=============

If you want to contribute by documenting, you need to 'get a github account<https://github.com/>'_. You can either contribute by 
- manually forking our project at https://github.com/ubports/docs.ubports.com, applying changes and submitting a pull request (PR) 
- or you visit the 'Ubports documentation on Read the Docs<http://docsubportscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>'_, click on the dark section in the lower left corner (with the label "Read the docs      v:latest" and click on Edit. This will take you to Github where you can edit the page you were just looking at and submitting a "proposal for file change".

The current plan is to **document in reStrucutredText (rst)** and you can find extensive Info about this 'here<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>'_. Most important is the 'Quick reStrucutredText<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#bullet-lists>'_ (Cheat Sheet) page where you find all the syntax you need.
