The Design Approch
==================

Ubuntu Touch offers a completely different approach to using your smartphone or tablet than using other mainstream operating systems. The OS is built on Ubuntu, which provides us with a secure and stable base system used by millions of people, servers, IoT devices and even cars.

Not a traditional PC Linux distribution
---------------------------------------

It is designed to run on the phone and tablet form factors, not on desktops and laptops. Second, it is designed to allow software developers to write applications that work across multiple devices, so the apps written for Ubuntu phones and tablets will work on Ubuntu desktops and laptops, and vice-versa.

It is built specifically around the requirements of running on mobile devices. This has led to some compromises, so you won't find some of the things you may be used to in the standard ubuntu desktop or other phone OS. 

It is a true open source phone that make you to research, and do more then receiving text and calls, allowing you to controlled by you so you be able to customize it as you please

User Interface
--------------

The intuitive user interface allows you to access all of your phone's features by swiping from the edges of the screen to access your apps, tools and settings all with one hand and no on-screen buttons. 

The homescreen comprises of the Scope Store, the music player, the messaging app, the dialer, the weather, the email app, the clock, the app launcher, and  settings.
