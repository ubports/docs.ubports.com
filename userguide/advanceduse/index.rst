============

This section of the documentation details advanced tasks that power users may want to perform on their Ubuntu Touch device.

.. note::
    Some of these guides involve making your system image writable, which may break OTA updates. The guides may also reduce the overall security of your Ubuntu Touch device. Please consider these ramifications before hacking on your device too much!
