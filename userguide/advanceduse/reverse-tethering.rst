   - Bring your tethering connection down: ``sudo nmcli connection down tethering``
   - Modify your tethering connection: ``sudo nmcli connection modify tethering ipv4.method auto``

#. Run the following commands on your *computer*: 

   - Get your interface name: ``ip route show to default via 10.42.0.1``
     ::

       default dev enx122626d0fe26 proto dhcp src 10.42.0.118 metric 101

   - Your interface name is: ``enx122626d0fe26``
   - Get your connection name: ``nmcli --field GENERAL.CONNECTION device show enx122626d0fe26``

       GENERAL.CONNECTION:                     Wired connection 2

   - Your connection name is ``Wired connection 2``
   - Bring the connection down: ``nmcli connection down "Wired connection 2"``
   - Change the ipv4 method to ``shared``: ``nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 2" ipv4.method shared``
