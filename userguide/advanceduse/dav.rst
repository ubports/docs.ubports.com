CalDAV and CardDAV syncing
==========================

CalDAV and CardDAV are protocols to sync calendars and contacts with a remote server.
Many e-mail hosters provide a CalDAV and CardDAV interface.

**Note:** CalDAV sync can also be set up by using the calendar app.
Open it, click on the little calendar icon in the top right corner and select "Add internet calendar > Generic CalDAV".
Enter your calendar URL as well as your username and password to complete the process.

At the moment, the Ubuntu Touch graphical user-interface lacks a CardDAV implementation, but you can do it by using SyncEvolution + cron. There is a script you can run in the terminal, or via a phablet SSH connection.
These instructions work for CalDAV as well.

1) Follow this `guide <https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/userguide/advanceduse/adb.html>`_ to activate Developer Mode and a connection either through ADB or SSH.


2) Download this `script <https://gist.github.com/bastos77/0c47a94dd0bf3e394f879c0ff42b7839>`_ (let's call it dav.sh) and edit the following variables: 

* Server side: CAL_URL, **CONTACTS_URL**, USERNAME, PASSWORD (of your ownCloud/nextCloud/baikal/SOGO/â€¦ server)
* CONTACT and CALENDAR _ NAME / VISUAL_NAME / CONFIG_NAME (it's more cosmetic)
* CRON_FREQUENCY (for the frequency of synchronization)
* Line 61: write ``sudo sh -c "echo '$COMMAND_LINE' > /sbin/sogosync"`` , instead of ``sudo echo "$COMMAND_LINE" > /sbin/sogosync``, to avoid a "Permission denied" error.

3) Move the file to your Ubuntu Touch device, either by way of a file manager or through the use of ADB:: 

    adb push dav.sh /home/phablet

4) Connect with the phablet shell (using ``adb shell``) or type the following directly into the Ubuntu Touch device terminal app::

    chmod +x dav.sh
    ./dav.sh
