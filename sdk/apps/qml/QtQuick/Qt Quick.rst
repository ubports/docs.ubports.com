QtQuick Qt Quick
================


The Qt Quick module is the standard library for writing QML applications. While the Qt QML module provides the QML engine and language infrastructure, the Qt Quick module provides all the basic types necessary for creating user interfaces with QML. It provides a visual canvas and includes types for creating and animating visual components, receiving user input, creating data models and views and delayed object instantiation.

The Qt Quick module provides both a QML API which supplies QML types for creating user interfaces with the QML language, and a C++ API for extending QML applications with C++ code.

**Note:** From Qt 5.1, a set of Qt Quick based UI controls is available to create user interfaces. Please see Qt Quick Controls for more information.

For those new to QML and Qt Quick, please see QML Applications for an introduction to writing QML applications.

Qt Quick provides everything needed to create a rich application with a fluid and dynamic user interface. It enables user interfaces to be built around the behavior of user interface components and how they connect with one another, and it provides a visual canvas with its own coordinate system and rendering engine. Animation and transition effects are a first class concept in Qt Quick, and visual effects can be supplemented through specialized components for particle and shader effects.

When using the ``QtQuick`` module, you will need to know how to write QML applications using the QML language. In particular, QML Basics and QML Essentials from the QML Applications page.

To find out more about using the QML language, see the Qt QML module documentation.
