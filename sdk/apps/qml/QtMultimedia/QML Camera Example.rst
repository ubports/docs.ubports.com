QtMultimedia QML Camera Example
===============================



This example demonstrates how to use the Qt Multimedia QML API to access camera functions. It shows how to change settings and to capture images.

To run the example from Qt Creator, open the **Welcome** mode and select the example from **Examples**. For more information, visit Building and Running an Example.

Most of the QML code supports the user interface for this application with the camera types being mostly found in *declarative-camera.qml* and *CaptureControls.qml*.

CaptureControls, which is implemented in *CaptureControls.qml*, generates a column on the right hand side of the screen which includes control buttons for focus (not initially visible), capture, flash modes, white balance, exposure compensation, and if a preview is available, a preview button. The last button exits from the application.
