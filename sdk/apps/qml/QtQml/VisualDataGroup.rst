Detailed Description
--------------------

The :ref:`VisualDataGroup <sdk_qtqml_visualdatagroup>` type provides a means to address the model data of a model's delegate items, as well as sort and filter these delegate items.

This type is provided by the Qt QML module due to compatibility reasons. The same implementation is now primarily available as DelegateModelGroup in the Qt QML Models module.

**See also** :ref:`QtQml.Models::DelegateModelGroup <sdk_qtqml_delegatemodelgroup>`.
