QtQml QML Examples - Internationalization
=========================================



The QML runtime automatically loads a translation from the i18n subdirectory of the root QML file, based on the system language.

The files are created or updated by running:

.. code:: cpp

    lupdate qml-i18n.qml -ts i18n/base.ts

Translations for new languages are created by copying *i18n/base.ts* to *i18n/qml\_<lang>.ts* The .ts files can then be edited with ï¿½{Qt Linguist}:

.. code:: cpp

    linguist i18n/qml_fr.ts

The run-time translation files are then generated by running:

.. code:: cpp

    lrelease i18n/*.ts

Files:

-  qml-i18n/qml-i18n.qml
-  qml-i18n/qml-i18n.qmlproject
