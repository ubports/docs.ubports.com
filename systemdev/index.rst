System software development
===========================

This section has various documents which will teach you how to work with the packages included with Ubuntu Touch. This includes the Ubuntu UI Toolkit, Unity8, and all of the other software that makes Ubuntu Touch what it is.

This section does not cover most of the *applications* preinstalled on Ubuntu Touch. See :doc:`/contribute/preinstalled-apps` for more information on those.

System Software guides
----------------------

These guides will give you general instructions on building and testing your own changes to Ubuntu Touch system software. They are not not an exhaustive reference on everything you will come across during development, but they are a great starting point.
