System software development
===========================

This section has various documents which will teach you how to work with the system level of Ubuntu Touch. This includes the Kernel, Android HAL, Ubuntu UI Toolkit, Unity8, and all of the other software that makes Ubuntu Touch what it is.

This section does not cover most of the *applications* preinstalled on Ubuntu Touch. See :doc:`/contribute/preinstalled-apps` for more information on those.
