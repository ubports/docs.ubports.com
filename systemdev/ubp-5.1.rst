hammerhead, bacon and FP2
=========================


This page documents how to build the Kernel and the Android image for the LG Nexus 5 (hammerhead), OnePlus One (bacon), or Fairphone 2 (FP2).

.. note::

    We highly suggest that you follow the :doc:`Halium porting guide <../porting/1_Intro>` if you want to bring up a new device. The steps in here are only relevant for hammerhead, bacon and FP2.

This document assumes you already have knowledge of building Android or Halium. It also assumes that your device has Ubuntu Touch installed.

Getting set up
--------------

``ubp-5.1`` ports must be built using Ubuntu 16.04. A container or virtual machine based on 16.04 is recommended for this purpose.

Let's get started by installing some build dependencies::

    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt update
    sudo apt install schedtool gcc g++ g++-multilib zlib1g-dev:i386 \
         zip libxml2-utils bc python-launchpadlib phablet-tools

Create a directory for your ``ubp-5.1`` source::

    mkdir ~/ubp-5.1
    cd ~/ubp-5.1

Next, we'll initialize the repository::

    repo init -u https://github.com/ubports/android -b ubp-5.1-allthefixings --depth=1

.. note::

    The ``allthefixings`` branch is provided for convenience. It adds all of the current UT device ports to the tree at the expense of a bit more downloaded data. If you are download-sensitive, initialize using ``-b ubp-5.1`` and use the manifest in `build-scripts <https://github.com/ubports/build-scripts>`__ to pick the repos you like.

Finally, we'll download the source::

    repo sync -j10 -c

Set up and build
----------------

With the sources downloaded, we need to set up our environment and build the images. Make sure you're in your ``ubp-5.1`` directory to continue through these steps.

First, bring in the default Android build environment::

    source build/envsetup.sh

Run ``lunch`` and pick the appropriate combo for your device. The name of the combination should start with ``cm_``, followed by the device name and ending with ``-userdebug``::

    lunch

With that done, the build can be started::

    mka

Install the new image
---------------------

Now that the build is complete, we can flash it to the device. Note that all of these commands should be run from a terminal which has been set up with ``source build/envsetup.sh`` and ``lunch`` to ensure the needed tools are in your PATH.

We'll begin with the boot and recovery images. Boot your device into fastboot mode and run the following commands::

    cout
    fastboot flash boot boot.img
    fastboot flash recovery recovery.img

Now boot your device to ensure your kernel build is sane. You may also want to boot into recovery to ensure it is working as well.

To install your new build of the system image, use the `replace-android-system script <https://github.com/janimo/phablet-porting-scripts/blob/68734ca07998b8e784397df77d9aca4b968b3815/build/replace-android-system>`_. It can be run as follows with your device attached::

    ./replace-android-system system.img
