Web apps
========

The fastest path to Ubuntu
--------------------------

Ubuntu webapps are web-hosted sites displayed inside an Ubuntu app
container. They are true apps that users install, see, launch and use.
But their content is provided through URLs.

If you’ve created HTML5 apps or mobile websites for other platforms -
there’s good news: you’re already almost on Ubuntu. We support both the
Webkit/Blink and Cordova development standards. And with a separate API
that enables websites to be quickly converted to run independently of a
browser, the same goes for your web applications.

Features
--------

-  **Super simple and easy to create** and publish
-  **Extend your websites** into converged Ubuntu as apps
-  **URL patterns** control what can be opened in webapp and what goes
   to browser while enabling complex apps drawn from multiple URLs
-  **Security**: Links to other URLs open in browser, so user cannot be
   spoofed
-  **Containment**: Webapps use isolated cookies, history, etc. that is
   not shared with any browser
-  **Integration with Ubuntu/Unity shell**: Found as an app, launched as
   an app, displayed as app
-  **Click packaged** and distributed through the **Ubuntu Software
   Store**
-  **Runs on Oxide**, a state-of-the-art web engine based on
   Blink/Chromium, optimized for Ubuntu
