About Geany
-----------

From `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geany>`__: > Geany
(IPA:ʒeːniː) is a lightweight GUI text editor using Scintilla and GTK+,
including basic IDE features. It is designed to have short load times,
with limited dependency on separate packages or external libraries on
Linux. It has been ported to a wide range of operating systems, such as
BSD, Linux, macOS,[4] Solaris and Windows. Because Windows lacks a
virtual terminal equivalent, the Windows port lacks an embedded terminal
window. Also missing from the Windows version are the external
development tools present under Unix, unless installed separately by the
user.[5] Among the supported programming languages and markup languages
are C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, LaTeX, CSS, Python, Perl,
Ruby, Pascal, Haskell, Erlang, Vala and many others.[6]

    In contrast to traditional Unix-based editors like Emacs or Vim,
    Geany more closely resembles programming editors common on Microsoft
    Windows such as Programmer's Notepad or Notepad++, both of which
    also use Scintilla.
