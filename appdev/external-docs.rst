API docs
========

In this section you find the various APIs you can use to develop Ubuntu Touch apps.

Firstly there are the QML and HTML APIs that you can use for the front end:

* `QML API <https://api-docs.ubports.com/sdk/apps/qml/index.html>`__
* `Cordova HTML5 API <https://api-docs.ubports.com/sdk/apps/html5/index.html>`__

Secondly, the platform documentation describes how to integrate your app into the system:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    platform/index

Thirdly, it is possible to develop cross-platform apps that don't depend on Ubuntu specific APIs, although this is not the official way of developing apps for Ubuntu Touch. If running on other operating systems is a requirement for your app, you can refer to these APIs instead:

* `Kirigami API <https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/html/>`__
* `Qt Quick Controls 2 API <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquickcontrols-index.html>`__
