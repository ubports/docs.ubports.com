Web applications
================

Ubuntu Webapps are a great way to deliver online web applications into Ubuntu.

The Ubuntu platform provides an advanced web engine container to run online applications on the Ubuntu client devices.

Web applications are hosted online. They can be as simple as a website, like an online news site, or they can distribute content like videos. They can also have a rich user interface or use the WebGL extension to deliver games online.

Note: Ubuntu webapps and Ubuntu HTML5 apps are similar but not identical. The main difference is that the content of a webapp is provided through a URL, whereas HTML5 apps install their content (and usually provide an Ubuntu HTML5 GUI). Webapps also have restricted access to platform APIs.
