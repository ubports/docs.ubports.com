Welcome to the Ubuntu App Platform!
===================================

Here is where you find a growing set of guides about Ubuntu as a
platform for developing apps -- whatever the app toolkit (QML or HTML5).
That is, Ubuntu provides a common app environment that developers need
to know about to make their apps really fantastic.

This is where **platform guides** come in: from simple tips to enhance
your app, to introductions to key topics, they are a great way to learn
the fundamentals from a top-down perspective before diving into API
docs.

Key topics
----------

Content Hub
~~~~~~~~~~~

Each application can expose content outside its sandbox, giving the user
precise control over what can be imported, exported or shared with the
world and other apps.

apps › <guides/content-hub-guide.md>`__

Push notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By using a push server and a companion client, instantly serve users
with the latest information from their network and apps.

URL dispatcher.

Performance tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be lightweight, be fast. A series of tips on how to avoid common

Online accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simplify user access to online services by integrating with the online
accounts API. Accounts added by the user on the device are registered in
a centralized hub, allowing other apps to re-use them.

app › <guides/online-accounts-developer-guide.md>`__

App confinement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What are privileged APIs? Why are apps untrusted by default? Get
familiar with our strong privacy and security policies and use them to
make your app shine in a confined environment.
