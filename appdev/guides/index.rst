We are currently working on expanding our list of developer guides. In the mean
time we recommend the `Ubuntu Touch Programming Course <https://mimecar.gitbook.io/qt-course/>`__.

If you are interested in helping create developer guides check out our
`GitLab Project <https://gitlab.com/ubports/apps/development-resources>`__.
