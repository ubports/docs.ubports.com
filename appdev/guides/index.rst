In a completely free and open source community, it is natural to have community members exploring the limits of the platform in many many directions. In this section you will find links to external resources that do exactly that: Explore. The purpose of this list is to show the unlimited possibilities of an open platform like Ubuntu Touch.

.. note::
    The resources listed here do not necessarily represent the officially endorsed way of developing applications for Ubuntu Touch, but are interesting experiments.
