Developer guides
================

We are currently working on expanding our list of developer guides. In the mean
time we recommend the `Ubuntu Touch Programming Course <https://mimecar.gitbooks.io/ubuntu-touch-programming-course/content/en/>`__.

If you are interested in helping create developer guides check out our
`GitLab Project <https://gitlab.com/ubports/ux/development-resources>`__.
