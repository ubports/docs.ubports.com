Getting Started
===============

We use Clickable as our build system. `Click here <http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/>`_ to get started using Clickable. 

Want to know more about Clickable first? Clickable is a meta-build system for Ubuntu Touch applications that allows you to compile, build, test and publish ``click`` packages and provides various templates to get you started with app development. It is currently the easiest and most convenient way of building click packages for Ubuntu Touch. You can use any code editor or IDE that you choose and build your apps from the commandline with Clickable.

Ubuntu Touch supports two kind of apps. :ref:`Native apps <nativeapp>` are apps with interfaces made using QML or HTML with their behavior defined in JavaScript, C++, Python, Rust or Go. :ref:`Web apps <webapp>` are special containers to run websites in.

Applications are shipped as a :ref:`Click <click>` package and can be publicly shared on the official app store `OpenStore <https://open-store.io>`__
