App development
===============

Great!, you'd like to develop an app for Ubuntu Touch. Here are some resources that we hope help you get started. 

If you have questions that aren't answered in the docs or want to chat with other Ubuntu Touch developers? Join our `app dev Telegram group <https://t.me/UbuntuAppDevEN>`_ or chat with us on the `UBports app dev forum <https://forums.ubports.com/category/35/app-development>`_.

Getting Started
---------------

`Clickable <http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/>`_ is a meta-build system for Ubuntu Touch applications that allows you to compile, build, test and publish ``click`` packages and provides various templates to get you started with app development. It is currently the easiest and most convenient way of building click packages for Ubuntu Touch. You can use any code editor or IDE that you choose and build your apps from the commandline with Clickable.

Ubuntu Touch supports two kind of apps. :ref:`Native apps <nativeapp>` are apps with interfaces made using QML or HTML with their behavior defined in JavaScript, C++, Python, Rust or Go. :ref:`Web apps <webapp>` are special containers to run websites in.

Applications are shipped as a :ref:`Click <click>` package and can be publicly shared on the official app store `OpenStore <https://open-store.io>`__

Code Editor Integrations
------------------------

You can use clickable with the `Atom Editor <https://atom.io>`__ by installing the `atom-clickable-plugin <https://atom.io/packages/atom-clickable-plugin>`__. This provides some common clickable tools needed to build and run click packages for Ubuntu Touch from within Atom editor.

Alternatively there is the old `Ubuntu SDK IDE <https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/platform/sdk>`__. Be aware that it is no longer supported by Canonical, and UBports has chosen to not support it either due to lack of manpower.

You can still install the SDK IDE in Ubuntu 16.04, but it is not guaranteed to work correctly. You can use the following commands to install::

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa
    sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade
    sudo apt install ubuntu-sdk
    sudo reboot # or logout/login

Documentation
-------------

* `QML API <https://api-docs.ubports.com/sdk/apps/qml/index.html>`__
* `Cordova HTML5 API <https://api-docs.ubports.com/sdk/apps/html5/index.html>`__
* `Clickable <http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/>`__
* `Suru Icons <http://docs.ubports.com/projects/icons/en/latest/>`__

It is possible to develop cross-platform apps that don't depend on Ubuntu specific APIs, although this is not the official way of developing apps for Ubuntu Touch. If running on other operating systems is an requirement for your app, you can refer to this  APIs instead:

* `Kirigami API <https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/html/>`__
* `Qt Quick Controls 2 API <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquickcontrols-index.html>`__
