Clickable
---------

Clickable is a meta-build system for Ubuntu Touch applications that allows you to compile, build, test and publish `click <https://click.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ packages. It is currently the easiest and most convenient way of building click packages for Ubuntu Touch.

See here for getting started `Read the Docs <http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/>`_.

Ubuntu UI-Toolkit
-----------------

Here you can find `the API documentation <https://api-docs.ubports.com/>`_ for the Ubuntu UI toolkit.

* `QML API <https://api-docs.ubports.com/sdk/apps/qml/index.html>`__
* `Cordova HTML5 API <https://api-docs.ubports.com/sdk/apps/html5/index.html>`__
* `Click packages <https://click.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

Ubuntu SDK IDE (unsupported)
----------------------------

The `Ubuntu SDK IDE <https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/platform/sdk>`__
is no longer supported by Canonical, and UBports does not currently have
the the time and manpower to get it to a working state.

It can still be installed in Ubuntu 16.04, but issues are expected.
