"The initramfs of the ubports-boot image takes a commandline parameter, "
"``datapart=``, which points it to the block device that is normally "
"mounted at ``/data`` in Android. This parameter is automatically embedded"
" into the image at build time by finding ``/data`` in your device's "
"default fstab and using its source. Unfortunately, this source is "
"generally a node in ``/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name`` or something else "
"strange, which is only available in an Android initramfs. To fix this, "
"Halium uses the fixup-mountpoints script, which you are probably familiar"
