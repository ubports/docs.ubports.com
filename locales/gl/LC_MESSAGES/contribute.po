msgid "Most apps running on Ubuntu Touch use `GNU gettext <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>`_ for translations. A *.pot* template file holds an apps strings. From this template for every language an individual *.po* file is derived. Those *.po* files do contain the actual translations. To add a new language a new *.po* file needs to be created. To translate a string the *.po* file needs to be edited. Next to the original string (english in most cases) the appropriate translation needs to be entered following the *.po* gettext file syntax. Some apps do use `QtLinguist <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtlinguist-index.html>`_ for translation. It does follow the same priciples only using *.ts* files for translations with another syntax. As template one *.ts* file is used."
