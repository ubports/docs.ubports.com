This parameter is automatically embedded into the image at build time by finding ``/data`` in your device's default fstab and using its source. Unfortunately, this source is generally a node in ``/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name`` or something else strange, which is only available in an Android initramfs. To fix this, Halium uses the fixup-mountpoints script, which you are probably familiar with by now."
