"To be specific, device vendors tend to keep the code that speaks directly to "
"the device hardware (the low level device drivers) proprietary. These "
"components are commonly called the 'vendor blobs'. The vendor blobs need to "
"be incorporated into an Ubuntu Touch port. Note that these components are "
"specific not only to each device, but also to each Android version. It is "
"therefore necessary to secure the correct version of these components when "
"building a port."

"specific device, because each device has its specific hardware architecture. "
