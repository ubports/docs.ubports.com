"On this page you'll find information on how to build Ubuntu Touch system "
"software for your device. Most of the software preinstalled on your "
"Ubuntu Touch device is shipped in the device image in the form of a "
"Debian package. This format is used by several Linux distributions, such "
"as Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. Plenty of `documentation on deb "
"packages <https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-"
"guide/index.en.html>`__ is available, so we won't be covering it here. "

"Crossbuilder is a script which automates the setup and use of a "

msgstr ""

#: ../../systemdev/testing-locally.rst:49

"Crossbuilder will create the LXD container, download the development "

":doc:`/userguide/advanceduse/adb` to learn more about connecting your "

"By default crossbuilder does not run unit tests; that's both for speed "

"to run native (target) executables: the development tools (qmake/cmake, "
"make, gcc, etc.) are all run in the host architecture, with no emulation "
"(again, for speed reasons). However, qemu emulation is available inside "
"the container, so it should be possible to run unit tests. You can do "
"that by getting a shell inside the container::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../systemdev/testing-locally.rst:60
msgid ""
"Then find the unit tests and execute them. Be aware that the emulation is"
" not perfect, so there's a very good chance that the tests will fail even"
