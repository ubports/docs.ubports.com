"Ubuntu Touch is an open source operating system for mobile devices. It can "
"be ported to devices that originally shipped with Android OS. Alas, the "
"majority of these devices are dependent to some degree on proprietary "
"software."

"To be specific, device vendors tend to keep the code that speaks directly to "
"the device hardware (the low level device drivers) proprietary. These "
"components are commonly called the 'vendor blobs'. The vendor blobs need to "
"be incorporated into an Ubuntu Touch port. Note that these components are "
"specific not only to each device, but also to each Android version. It is "
"therefore necessary to secure the correct version of these components when "
"building a port."
msgstr ""

#: ../../porting/Intro.rst:17
msgid ""
"This is why Ubuntu Touch cannot be built completely from source code for "
"most commercial devices. Instead, porting the system to these devices "

"the system, which can be built from source."

"The next component of Ubuntu Touch is a pre-compiled root filesystem which "
"needs to be installed on the device. This component does not communicate "
"directly with the device hardware. Instead, this communication is mediated "
"by a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) which needs to be built for each "
"specific device, because each device has its specific hardware architecture. "
"This component is called Halium and is available in different versions (5.1 "
"which is largely obsolete, 7.1, and 9 as of writing) corresponding to "
"different Android versions."

"The Halium project enables Linux systems to run on Android hardware. It is a "
