More specifically, such branch names start with a release-specific name followed by a chain of distribution names separated by ``_-_``. For example ``ubports/focal_-_my-feature`` instructs the CI system to resolve build dependencies using the ``focal`` and, if it already exists, a ``my-feature`` distribution.  The resulting packages will be published on ``repo2.ubports.com`` in their own separate distribution ``my-feature``.
