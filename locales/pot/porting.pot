By using the shared script, your port will receive the latest changes in device tarball building as rootfs continues to evolve (e.g. for 22.04 or newer).

This is often achived by overlaying the ``mount-android.conf`` Upstart job to either contain the code itself, or to call another script. Since Ubuntu Touch 20.04 no longers use Upstart (see below), the code will no longer run. If your port ships your overlay files under ``/opt/halium-overlay`` or ``/usr/share/halium-overlay``, the new overlay system will take care of it automatically, except when the new file is added in which case you may need ``.halium-overlay-dir`` (see :ref:`Overlay`)."

msgid "In general, there are two methods of implementing overlay files, one is to directly copy them to the destination path potentially overwriting existing files, the other is to place them in a designated base directory from where they are then mounted onto their destination path during the boot process. The former is only possible when doing builds using the GitLab CI scripts. In case of Ubuntu Touch 16.04 it is the only available overlay mechanism. While the ``system.img`` build process allows overwriting files on the built Android system partition it has no means of doing so on the root filesystem. Ubuntu Touch 16.04 does however offer limited support of mount-based overlay files. Starting from Ubuntu Touch 20.04, the implementation of mount-based overlay files has become more powerful in terms of overlaying both files and directories in vendor and Android images regardless of the build method. The use of mount-based overlay files is generally preferable as it allows for delta OTA updates. Both mechanisms will be discussed in detail below before describing how overlay files are included into the build process in full system image builds and builds based on GitLab CI scripts."
