Introduction
============

This is the documentation for the UBports project. Our goal is to create a Free and open-source (GPL if possible) mobile operating system that converges and respects your freedom.

About UBports
-------------

The UBports project was founded by Marius Gripsgard in 2015 and in its infancy was a place where developers could share ideas and educate each other in hopes of bringing the Ubuntu Touch platform to more mobile devices.

After Canonical suddenly announced `their plans to terminate support of Ubuntu Touch <https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/>`_ in April 2017, UBports and its sister projects began work on the open-source code, maintaining and expanding its possibilities for the future.
